U2FP wanted to rework a website that incorporated the stories and pictures of spinal cord injury survivors. We were asked to rework the current site and content – focusing on the storytelling process, while giving a tight and clean design.

Usability for all was an important component. Each story tells a snapshot of one life. In addition, a random assortment of stories is dynamically created so that each time a visitor arrives at the site they are visited by different stories.

Stories is powered by WordPress and is mobile friendly.
