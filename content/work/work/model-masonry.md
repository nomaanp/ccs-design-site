Model Masonry & Tile’s goal was to develop an Internet presence that integrates social media, referral services, multi-media and a photography portfolio. Working from the principles of minimalism; we created a clean, crisp modern design that utilizes current web standards to display slideshows and portfolios dynamically.

The site is built on an open source WordPress content management system which promotes simple maintenance and future adaptation.
