    Bella Surfaces LLC has over 20 years of combined experience in installing custom surfaces in kitchens, bathrooms, fireplaces, playrooms and commercial facilities throughout the New England area.

    Ibis Interactive designed and developed a responsive WordPress website. The goal was create an initial web presence and showcase some examples of custom marble, granite and other fine stonework. The result is a minimal portfolio site that is easy to maintain and focuses on their unique techniques and craft.
